## About Shiatsu

Shiatsu is a form of Japanese Meridian massage. It is a gentle but highly effective bodywork technique that excels at releasing both physical and emotional blockages.

Cupping is an ancient therapeutic technique that has appeared in different forms in various medical traditions across the world.  In Chinese fire cupping, a glass "cup" is used to create suction on the body.  The negative pressure within the cup looses the muscle tissue beneath, promotes blood flow to the area, and sedates the nervous system.  It is used to loosen tight muscles, promote movement of blood and lymph fluid, and loosen and open areas of stuckness.  Cupping is also deeply relaxing and can calm the body and mind during times of stress or anxiety.
