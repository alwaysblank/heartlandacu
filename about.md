## About Community Acupuncture

Community Acupuncture is a low-cost, sliding scale alternative to traditional one-on-one acupuncture treatment. During a community acupuncture session multiple people receive acupuncture treatments while in the same room. Doing acupuncture on a group of people instead of one at a time allows costs to be kept low, and creates a relaxing and supportive atmosphere for treatment.

Patients rest in either reclining chairs or on tables and remain fully clothed during treatment, primarily acupuncture points on the extremities, scalp, and ears are used, though sometimes points on the chest and abdomen are included.

Intakes are brief and conducted in whispers for privacy.

A calm, quiet, and safe atmosphere is maintained at all times in the group treatment room.

Patients may rest as long as they like; at least a 30 minute needle retention time is recommended and acu-napping is encouraged!

Acupuncture is most effective cumulatively so frequency and consistency are important in achieving your health goals with acupuncture treatment.

Side effects include: better sleep and mood, reduced pain, improved digestion and increased energy.
