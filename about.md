## About Community Acupuncture

Community Acupuncture is a low-cost, sliding scale alternative to traditional one-on-one acupuncture treatment. During a community acupuncture session multiple people receive acupuncture treatments while in the same room. Doing acupuncture on a group of people instead of one at a time allows costs to be kept low, and creates a relaxing and supportive atmosphere for treatment.

Patients rest in either reclining chairs or on tables and remain fully clothed during treatment, primarily acupuncture points on the extremities, scalp, and ears are used, though sometimes points on the chest and abdomen are included.

Intakes are brief and conducted in whispers for privacy.

A calm, quiet, and safe atmosphere is maintained at all times in the group treatment room.

Patients may rest as long as they like; at least a 30 minute needle retention time is recommended and acu-napping is encouraged!

Acupuncture is most effective cumulatively so frequency and consistency are important in achieving your health goals with acupuncture treatment.

Side effects include: better sleep and mood, reduced pain, improved digestion and increased energy.

## About Shiatsu

Shiatsu is a form of Japanese Meridian massage. It is a gentle but highly effective bodywork technique that excels at releasing both physical and emotional blockages.  Shiatsu is traditionally performed with the recipient fully clothed reclining on a futon rather than on a massage table.  The practitioner uses passive stretches and gentle to firm pressure along the meridians of the body to promote the flow of Qi and blood, reduce pain and tension, and calm the spirit.

## About Shiatsu+Acupuncture

These one-on-one sessions combine local and distal needling techniques with shiatsu massage and/or cupping focused on releasing particular areas of pain, tension, or blockage.  Combining the two modalities produces a powerful therapeutic effect.  The private nature of the session allows for local needling of the body, including trigger point release and protocols utilizing the back and core.  The treatment is performed on a massage table, and the recipient will either remain fully clothed, or be draped appropriately to access certain acupuncture points.

## About Cupping

Cupping is an ancient therapeutic technique that has appeared in different forms in various medical traditions across the world.  In Chinese fire cupping, a glass "cup" is used to create suction on the body.  The negative pressure within the cup looses the muscle tissue beneath, promotes blood flow to the area, and sedates the nervous system.  It is used to loosen tight muscles, promote movement of blood and lymph fluid, and loosen and open areas of stuckness.  Cupping is also deeply relaxing and can calm the body and mind during times of stress or anxiety.
