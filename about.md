## About Shiatsu

Shiatsu is a form of Japanese Meridian massage. It is a gentle but highly effective bodywork technique that excels at releasing both physical and emotional blockages.  Shiatsu is traditionally performed with the recipient fully clothed reclining on a futon rather than on a massage table.  The practitioner uses passive stretches and gentle to firm pressure along the meridians of the body to promote the flow of Qi and blood, reduce pain and tension, and calm the spirit.

## About Acupuncture

These one-on-one sessions include local and distal needling techniques as well as shiatsu massage, cupping, and essential oil acupoint therapy as needed. focused on releasing particular areas of pain, tension, or blockage.  The treatment is performed on a massage table, and the recipient will either remain fully clothed, or be draped appropriately to access certain acupuncture points. 

Acupuncture is most effective cumulatively so frequency and consistency are important in achieving your health goals with acupuncture treatment.

## About Cupping

Cupping is an ancient therapeutic technique that has appeared in different forms in various medical traditions across the world.  In Chinese fire cupping, a glass "cup" is used to create suction on the body.  The negative pressure within the cup looses the muscle tissue beneath, promotes blood flow to the area, and sedates the nervous system.  It is used to loosen tight muscles, promote movement of blood and lymph fluid, and loosen and open areas of stuckness.  Cupping is also deeply relaxing and can calm the body and mind during times of stress or anxiety.
