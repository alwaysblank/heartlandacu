title: Does Acupuncture Hurt?
---

Acupuncture certainly does not need to be painful in order to work!  Most people find their acupuncture treatments highly relaxing and often fall asleep, waking relaxed and refreshed.  It is normal to feel sensation in the body during acupuncture treatment--either at the site of the needle or in completely different parts of the body.  This might be a heaviness, buzzing, tingling, warmth, or gentle throbbing--or something else.  As long as it is not painful or uncomfortable its just the needles doing their work.
