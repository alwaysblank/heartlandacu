Acupuncture treatment is cumulative in effect, and usually requires frequency and regularity of treatment to achieve significant lasting results. As a general rule, most conditions will require that you come at least once or twice per week until your symptoms have resolved. Your acupuncturist will come up with specific treatment plan tailored to your health history and treatment goals. See the chart at the bottom of this page for a general idea of how many treatments are recommended for different conditions. If you want to come more frequently than recommended that's fine too! Daily acupuncture is a wonderful thing, and we are always happy to see you.
