Acupuncture in the insertion of hair-thin needles into certain points on the body in order to create a therapeutic and healing effect. These particular points are located on “meridians” or “channels” that wind through the body like a river system or a road map, connecting all parts of the body--organs, tissues, bodily fluids, as well as impulses and feelings--in a synergistic web. Through these channels and many small collateral pathways our Qi moves. In a state of health, it flows freely and abundantly. In a state of disease, it is insufficient, blocked, or stagnant. By stimulating the acu-points along these channels, an acupuncture treatment encourages the body to rebalance its Qi. This activation of the body’s own healing potential can be incredibly powerful, and has the distinct advantage of a total lack of unwanted side effects.
