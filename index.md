Dear Friends & Values Customers,

As of June 23, 2018, Heartland Community Acupuncture will be closed.

Starting in August 2018, I am joining forces with my partner, Chinese Herbalist Sean Dugan at [Chinese Medicine of Iowa](www.iowachinesemedicine.com), where we will be offering Chinese Herbal Medicine, Acupuncture, and a variety of other wonderful healing modalities in one location! 

Our clinic, Chinese Medicine of Iowa, is located [here](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/chinese+medicine+of+iowa/@41.0383562,-92.0397397,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x87e665ea1827a0e1:0x39b90bac07f94500!2m2!1d-91.9696998!2d41.0383774), at the Golden Gate Building at 2094 185th Street, Suite #3, Fairfield IA 52556. 

To make an appointment with me there, please visit [www.iowachinesemedicine.com](www.iowachinesemedicine.com) or call me at 319.535.3512.

I look forward to seeing you in my new location in August!

Regular Community Acupuncture hours will continue through Friday June 22.  Following that date I will unfortunately no longer be offering Community Acupuncture sessions until further notice.

See you soon & be well!

~Mara Bateman, LAc
