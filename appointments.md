## First Visit

Please arrive 15 minutes early for your first visit to fill out paperwork.

## Appointments

Treatments are given in a large room containing number of recliners. The shared treatment space creates a very relaxed and healing atmosphere.

Appointments last approximately 30-60 minutes. After the needles are in, you can rest as long as you like; you decide when you are done with your treatment! If you need to leave at a specific time just let your acupuncturist know, and she will get you up on time. It is common to doze off during treatment and wake up feeling relaxed and refreshed.

Wear comfortable loose clothing that may be rolled up above the knees and elbows. Make sure you have eaten within a couple of hours of coming in. Drink plenty of water or tea following the treatment.

## Payment

We take cash, check or card. We do not bill insurance due to our sliding scale payment model. Please pay prior to treatment. 

Return visits are $15-$35. First visits are $25-$45, including the addition of a one-time $10 intake fee. Pay what you are able; we never ask about income.

## Closing Time

We close 45 minutes following the last appointment time on the schedule.

## Cancellations

We request that you give 24 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. **More than two last minute cancellations will result in a $15 cancellation fee.** There is no charge for canceling due to emergency or illness; if you have an infectious illness please rest at home.
