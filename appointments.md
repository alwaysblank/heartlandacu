## First Community Acupuncture Visit

Please allow at least an hour for your first community acupuncture visit so that you can fill out paperwork and still have time for a treatment.

## Community Acupuncture Sessions

Treatments are given in a large room containing number of recliners. The shared treatment space creates a very relaxed and healing atmosphere.

Appointments last approximately 30-90 minutes. After the needles are in, you can rest as long as you like; you decide when you are done with your treatment! If you need to leave at a specific time just let your acupuncturist know, and she will get you up on time. It is common to doze off during treatment and wake up feeling relaxed and refreshed.

Wear comfortable loose clothing that may be rolled up above the knees and elbows. Make sure you have eaten within a couple of hours of coming in. Drink plenty of water or tea following the treatment.

**For more information about Community-style Acupuncture, [visit the About page](/about/).**

## Shiatsu Sessions

Shiatsu sessions are performed one-on-one and last 45 minutes.  It is also important to wear comfortable soft clothing for shiatsu as the massage is performed clothed and involves some passive stretching.

## **Acupuncture+Shiatsu Sessions**

Shiatsu+Acupuncture sessions are performed one-on-one and last 60 minutes.  If it is your first visit to HCA for acupuncture (you have never been in for a community session) you need to arrive 15 minutes early to fill our paperwork.

Wear soft and comfortable clothing that may be rolled up past the knee and elbow.  Make sure you have eaten within a few hours before coming in and drink plenty of water or tea following treatment.

## Payment

We take cash, check or card, though cash or check is preferable due to high processing fees. We do not bill insurance due to our sliding scale payment model. Please pay prior to treatment. 

Acupuncture return visits are $15-$35. First visits are $25-$45, including the addition of a one-time $10 intake fee.  

Pay what you are able; we never ask about income.

You may pre-pay for multiple treatments by purchasing a 5 or 10 treatment package.  You will receive a punchcard and simply mark off visits as you go, so you don't have to worry about bringing to correct cash, checkbook, etc.  The 5 treatment package is $125 and the 10 treatment package is $250.  They are valid for one year from time of purchase.

Shiatsu sessions are $45-$60 for 45 minutes.

Acupuncture+Shiatsu sessions are $65-$80 for 1 hour.

**Health Savings Cards are accepted for private Acupuncture treatments.  I am also happy to make you a super-bill to send to your insurance provider if they cover acupuncture.**

## Closing Time

Walk-ins are accepted during community acupuncture hours until 15 minutes before listed closing time.  All treatments will be ended by 20 minutes following listed closing time.

## Cancellations

We request that you give 12 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. ** Cancelling less than 12 hours in advance or failing to show up to a scheduled appointment will result in a $15 cancellation fee in the case of acupuncture and a $45 fee in the case of shiatsu massage or shiatsu+acupuncture session.** There is no charge for canceling due to emergency or illness;** if you have an infectious illness please rest at home.**
