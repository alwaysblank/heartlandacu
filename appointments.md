## Shiatsu Sessions

Shiatsu sessions are performed one-on-one and last 45 minutes.  It is also important to wear comfortable soft clothing for shiatsu as the massage is performed clothed and involves some passive stretching.

**For more information about Shiatsu, [visit the About page](/about/).**

## **Acupuncture Sessions**

Acupuncture sessions are performed one-on-one and last 60 minutes.  If it is your first visit to HCA for acupuncture (you have never been in for a community session) you need to arrive 15 minutes early to fill our paperwork.

Wear soft and comfortable clothing that may be rolled up past the knee and elbow.  Make sure you have eaten within a few hours before coming in and drink plenty of water or tea following treatment.

For more information, [visit the About page](http://www.heartlandacu.com/about). 

## Cancellations

We request that you give 12 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. ** Cancelling less than 12 hours in advance or failing to show up to a scheduled appointment will result in a $15 cancellation fee in the case of acupuncture and a $45 fee in the case of shiatsu massage or shiatsu+acupuncture session.** There is no charge for canceling due to emergency or illness;** if you have an infectious illness please rest at home.**
