## First Visit

Please arrive 15 minutes early for your first visit to fill out paperwork.

## Appointments

Treatments are given in a large room containing number of recliners. The shared treatment space creates a very relaxed and healing atmosphere.

Appointments last approximately 30-60 minutes. After the needles are in, you can rest as long as you like; you decide when you are done with your treatment! If you need to leave at a specific time just let your acupuncturist know, and she will get you up on time. It is common to doze off during treatment and wake up feeling relaxed and refreshed.

Wear comfortable loose clothing that may be rolled up above the knees and elbows. Make sure you have eaten within a couple of hours of coming in. Drink plenty of water or tea following the treatment.

Shiatsu sessions are performed one-on-one and last 45 minutes.  It is also important to wear comfortable soft clothing for shiatsu as the massage is performed clothed and involves some passive stretching.

## Payment

We take cash, check or card. We do not bill insurance due to our sliding scale payment model. Please pay prior to treatment. 

Acupuncture return visits are $15-$35. First visits are $25-$45, including the addition of a one-time $10 intake fee. 

Shiatsu sessions are $45-$60 for 45 minutes.

Pay what you are able; we never ask about income.

## Closing Time

We close 30 minutes following the last appointment time on the schedule.

## Cancellations

We request that you give 12 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. ** Cancelling less than 12 hours in advance or failing to show up to a scheduled appointment will result in a $15 cancellation fee in the case of acupuncture and a $45 fee in the case of shiatsu massage.** There is no charge for canceling due to emergency or illness; if you have an infectious illness please rest at home.
